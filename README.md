# Fighting with/against constraints

Very simple XCode test project to get acquainted with xcode constraints

Having little experience using constraints to format a Mac user interface a trial using a custom view filled with colors embedded in a Stack was successfully build up. It is easy to set the constraints having 3 equally sized colored fields adpting well to the window size. 
Therefore I thought having some basic understanding on how to use constraints. But I completely fail using constraints together with NSTextField or NSTextView. Goal is to achieve 3 texts above each other as shown when pressing the “Program” button. The other buttons show 2 alternatives showing my fails. I even achieved a solution that was working as long the NSTextView had no scrollers, but this version looked very strange in IB builder.
